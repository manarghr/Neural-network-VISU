WHAT IS RAYLIB ? 
Raylib is a simple C library designed for creating games and multimedia applications.
It provides functions for handling graphics, audio, window management.

CODE EXPLANATION : 

#include"raylib.h"  --> this library provides functions for graphics, it is used for the creation of the window, the neurons (circles) and the lines (connections).
#include<math.h>    --> this math library in C provides mathematical functions like sin() used to make the neurons move (bounce up and down over time).
#include<stdlib.h>  --> the standard library provides functions for memory allocation, random number generation and program control.


#define SCREEN_WIDTH 1200   --> the window will be 1200 pixels wide.
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 600   --> and 600 pixels tall.
#define NEURON_RADIUS 30    --> this defines the the size of each neuron.

typedef struct neuron{
   float x, y;              -->  x represents the horizontal position of the neuron, y represents the vertical position of the neuron.
   float base_y;            -->  helps keep track of the original position for animation.
   Color color;             -->  defines the color of the neuron.
} Neuron;

Neuron CreateNeuron(float x, float y, Color color){
  Neuron neuron ;           --> creating a variable "neuron" of type Neuron.
  neuron.x = x;             --> sets the horizontal position x of the neuron (ex : x=100.0f sets position to 100 pixels from the left of the screen).
  neuron.y = y;             --> sets the vertical position y of the neuron (ex : y=100.0f sets position to 100 pixels from the top of the screen).
  neuron.base_y = y;        --> keeps track of where the neuron started, if it moves you can refer to this original position).
  neuron.color = color;     --> sets the color of the neuron ( ex : color=GREEN the neuron will be green).
  return neuron;
}
