# **Neural Network Visualization using Raylib and Notepad++**

I initially started with SDL for the project, but i faced various issues and difficulties in setting it up. So, I switched to Raylib and used Notepad++ as a code editor and it worked. 

###How to use them both ? 
1) Install Raylib via https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib
2) Install Notepad++ via https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads
3) Now, Open Notepad++, then go to file > open > now go to "Disque Local" where the raylib folder is and then click on it > npp > click on Notepad++.exe
