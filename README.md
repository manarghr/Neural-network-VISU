# **Neural Network Visualization using Raylib and Notepad++**

I initially started with SDL for the project, but i faced various issues and difficulties in setting it up. So, I switched to Raylib and used Notepad++ as a code editor and it worked. 

### How to use them both ? 
1) Install Raylib via https://raysan5.itch.io/raylib
2) Install Notepad++ via https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads
3) Now, Open files then> "Disque Local" where the raylib folder is and then click on it > raylib > examples > core > click on core_basic_window.c
4) the file appears in Notepad++, then go to plugins > admin > download NppExec and NppExecScript
5) After that, you can modify the file "core_basic_window.c" and write the code you want there, and that's it.
